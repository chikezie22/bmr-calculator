# BASAL METABOLIC RATE (BMR) CALCULATOR

The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calculator is a simple React application that estimates the minimum amount of energy (calories) your body needs to keep functioning while at rest. The BMR is essential for understanding how many calories your body requires to maintain basic physiological functions such as keeping your heart beating and brain working, even when you are inactive.

## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

The BMR Calculator uses the Revised Harris-Benedict Equation to provide accurate estimates of your daily calorie needs. The equation differs for men and women:

- **For Men**: BMR = (13.397W + 4.799H) – (5.677A + 88.362)
- **For Women**: BMR = (9.247W + 3.098H) – (4.330A + 447.593)

Where:
- W = Weight in Pounds
- H = Height in Feet
- A = Age

## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting personal data (weight, height, age, and gender).
- Calculates and displays the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).
- Provides an engaging welcome message to guide users.

## Live-Demo
- Here is a live demo

## Installation

To get started with the BMR Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bmr-calculator.git
   cd bmr-calculator
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Open the application.
2. Enter your weight in pounds, height in feet, and age.
3. Select your gender.
4. Click on the "Calculate Your BMR Now!" button.
5. The application will display your BMR, which is the minimum number of calories your body needs to function at rest.


## Equation Used

The Revised Harris-Benedict Equation is used to calculate the BMR:

- **For Men**: BMR = (13.397W + 4.799H) – (5.677A + 88.362)
- **For Women**: BMR = (9.247W + 3.098H) – (4.330A + 447.593)
